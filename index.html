i feel like im not really 'incarnated' properly
i am unable to grasp the material reality with the full intensity that is required of me, a part of me seems to reside far away beyond the felt reality, of what is known and tangible. my interactions with the world happen through a sensorial and emotional bubble wrap; dull, cold, lifeless. it truly feels i am piloting a marionette, knowing that i really should supposed to be embodying it. although i just cannot. the highs and the lows, the joys and the hits, i understand them, intutiviely and intellectually i conceptualise, but cannot absorb them. they don't integrate into my being where they should serve for growth.

experiences seem to wholly go through me instead of just staying within me and creating me; the memories remain but not the meaning, not what should be there. what should have served as the building blocks of a personality have been almost wholly flushed away: what results is a person who's just as lost as the kid they once were, not in terms of physical necessities, but in the sense of self. no goals, no plan of execution, no drive. just being.

theres a piece missing or malfunctioning in the mechanism that shapes a person. nature or nurture, body or mind, i don't know. i remain a self aware observer who cant act out his existence and suffers from it, as life demands more than just, 'being present'.<br/><br/>
